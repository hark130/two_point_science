# TWO POINT SCIENCE

An attempt at applying analytical science to the game Two Point Hospital.

## BACKGROUND

[Two Point Hospital](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwig1p_w0v3zAhWObc0KHWpMAfoQFnoECAQQAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.twopointhospital.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3GGa9E7TMAXQYTby7TBfyd) is a humurous business simulation game focused on hospital management.  With all the DLC, there are 33 hospitals to manage each with its own unique layout, environmental considerations, and (most importantly) a unique list of ailments to diagnose and treat.

## GOAL

The goal of this project is to programmatically aid the planning of each unique hospital based on room density and patient "pathing", if "pathing" is defined as "the a->b->c->d room path each patient takes as they are diagnosed and treated."

## DETAILS

two_point_science is written in Python 3.8.10 and relies heavily on the matplotlib and networkx Python libraries.  It was developed in Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS.

## FEATURES

The `tps` package currently generates an undirected acyclic graph for [Grockle Bay](https://two-point-hospital.fandom.com/wiki/Grockle_Bay).

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/hark130/two_point_science.git
python -m tps
```
